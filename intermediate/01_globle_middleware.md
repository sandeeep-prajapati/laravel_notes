Laravel Middleware:

- Middleware are layers that sit between the request and the application.
- They filter and manipulate the request before it reaches the application.
- Middleware can perform tasks such as:
    - Authentication
    - Authorization
    - CSRF protection
    - Logging
    - Error handling
- Middleware are defined in the app/Http/Kernel.php file.
- Middleware can be assigned to routes using the middleware method.

Types of Middleware:

- Global Middleware: Runs on every request.
- Assign Middleware: Runs on specific routes or route groups.
- Middleware Groups: Group multiple middleware together.

Example:

// app/Http/Kernel.php

protected $middleware = [
    // Global Middleware
    \App\Http\Middleware\Logger::class,
];

protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // Assign Middleware
    'auth' => \App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
];

Route with Middleware:

Route::get('/admin', 'AdminController@index')->middleware('auth');

Middleware Example:

// app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class Authenticate
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        if (!Auth::check()) {
            return redirect()->route('login');
        }
        return $next($request);
    }
}
