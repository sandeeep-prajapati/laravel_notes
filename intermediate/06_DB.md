Laravel Query Builder:

- The Query Builder is a fluent interface for building and executing database queries.
- It provides a simple and concise way to perform various database operations.
- It supports various query types: select, insert, update, delete, and more.

Methods:

- select(): Specify the columns to select.
- from(): Specify the table to query.
- where(): Add conditions to the query.
- orWhere(): Add conditional clauses to the query.
- whereIn(): Add "IN" conditions to the query.
- whereNotIn(): Add "NOT IN" conditions to the query.
- orderBy(): Sort the results.
- limit(): Limit the number of results.
- offset(): Offset the results.
- join(): Perform joins on tables.
- groupBy(): Group the results.
- having(): Add conditions to the grouped results.
- insert(): Insert new records.
- update(): Update existing records.
- delete(): Delete records.

Example:

$users = DB::table('users')
    ->select('name', 'email')
    ->where('age', '>', 18)
    ->orderBy('name', 'asc')
    ->limit(10)
    ->get();

This query selects the name and email columns from the users table, where the age is greater than 18, sorts the results by name in ascending order, and limits the output to 10 records.

Note: The Query Builder also provides methods for more advanced queries, such as subqueries, unions, and more.
