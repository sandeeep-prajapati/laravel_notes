Laravel Session:

- Sessions are used to store data that is accessible across multiple requests.
- Laravel provides a fluent interface for working with sessions.
- Sessions are stored in the SESSION facade.

Basic Usage:

- Store data in the session:

Session::put('key', 'value');

- Retrieve data from the session:

$value = Session::get('key');

- Check if a key exists in the session:

if (Session::has('key')) {
    // Key exists
}

- Remove data from the session:

Session::forget('key');

- Flash data to the session (only available for the next request):

Session::flash('key', 'value');

- Retrieve flashed data:

$value = Session::get('key');

Note: Session data is stored in the SESSION facade, which is an instance of Illuminate\Session\Store.

Session Driver:

- Laravel supports various session drivers, including:
    - File (default)
    - Cookie
    - Database
    - Redis
    - Memcached
    - Array (for testing)

Session Configuration:

- Configure session settings in the config/session.php file.
- Set the session driver, lifetime, and other options.

Best Practices:

- Use sessions sparingly, as they can impact performance.
- Store only essential data in sessions.
- Use the Session facade instead of the $_SESSION superglobal.
- Avoid storing sensitive data in sessions.
