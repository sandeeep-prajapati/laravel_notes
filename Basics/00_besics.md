Step 2: Install Laravel

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project_name

Replace project_name with your desired project name.

Step 3: Move to the project directory

cd project_name

Step 4: Install dependencies

composer install

Step 5: Start the development server

php artisan serve

This will start the Laravel development server, and you can access your project at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

That's it! You now have Laravel installed and running.

Note: Make sure you have PHP installed on your system, and the version should be 7.3 or higher.
