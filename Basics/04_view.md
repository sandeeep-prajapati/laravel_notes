Laravel Views:

- Views are responsible for rendering the user interface (UI) of your application.
- Views are stored in the resources/views directory.
- Views are typically HTML files with PHP code.
- Laravel uses the Blade templating engine to render views.

Basic View:

// resources/views/home.blade.php

<h1>Welcome to Laravel!</h1>

Controller passing data to View:

// HomeController.php

public function index()
{
    $name = 'John';
    return view('home', compact('name'));
}

View displaying data:

// resources/views/home.blade.php

<h1>Welcome, {{ $name }}!</h1>

Blade Directives:

@extends('layout')  // Extends a layout
@section('content')  // Starts a section
@endforeach  // Ends a loop
@if($condition)  // Starts a conditional block
@endif  // Ends a conditional block

Include View:

@include('partials.nav')

View Composer:

// ViewComposer.php

public function compose(View $view)
{
    $view->with('name', 'John');
}
